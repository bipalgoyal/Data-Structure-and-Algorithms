# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms
This repository contains all of the labs and assignments that I have completed as part of my Data Structures class at the University of Cincinnati. All labs were done in pairs, my partner was Mr. Simon Fiest.

### Lab 1: Arrays and Structures
A simple lab where we familiarize ourselves with the IDE, and practice using structures and arrays. 

### Lab 2: Classes and Multi-File Programs
In this lab, we create a console based basketball game, and implement it by defining a custom class for our player.

### Lab 3: Classes and Operator Overloading
We create a class for complex numbers and overload some operators for performing arithmetic operations on complex numbers.

### Lab 4: Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstract classes
In this lab, we practice the concepts by creating base and derived classes, and test them in a main program.

### Lab 5: Templates and Exceptions
For this lab, we create classes that are templates and also create some custom exceptions for our classes. Data structure implemented is a simple stack.

### Homework 1: Files
In this assignment, we practiced with reading data from files, and then displaying said data, and storing some new data in a new file.

### Homework 2: Classes
In this assignment, we created a console based roulette game, using multiple classes.
