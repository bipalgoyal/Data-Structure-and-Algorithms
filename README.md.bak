# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms
This repository contains all of the labs and assignments that I have completed as part of my Data Structures class at the University of Cincinnati.

### Lab 1: Arrays and Structures
A simple lab where we familiarize ourselves with the IDE, and practice using structures and arrays. 

### Lab 2: Classes and Multi-File Programs
In this lab, we create a console based basketball game, and implement it by defining a custom class for our player.

### Lab 3: Classes and Operator Overloading
We create a class for complex numbers and overload some operators for performing arithmetic operations on complex numbers.
